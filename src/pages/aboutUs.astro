          About Us
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Hi there! We’re Sam and Neha, lifelong friends who’ve known each other for 25 years. From classrooms to grad school, we’ve shared almost everything—even becoming roommates!
          <br /><br />
          Like many international students, we struggled with apartment hunting. Over two years, we moved three times, relying on photos and videos that didn’t capture the real vibe of a space. It was frustrating and stressful.
          <br /><br />
          That’s why we created <strong>3D-Ready</strong> and <strong>The Point Cloud</strong>. We wanted a better way to see apartments—clearly and in 3D—so no one has to guess what they’re signing up for.

        <li><strong>Save space:</strong> 3D models are smaller than photos, making storage and sharing easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined experience:</strong> No need to manage multiple images and videos of every room.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate visualization:</strong> See the apartment exactly as it is, with no surprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Save time:</strong> Fewer video calls and in-person tours for landlords and tenants.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick generation:</strong> Easily create 3D models with cutting-edge technology.</li>
      </ul>
